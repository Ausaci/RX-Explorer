### Basic syntax format
#### AQS statement structure
*****
`<Query>`

`(<Query>)`

`<Query>` `AND` `<Query>` (equivalent to `<Query>` `<Query>`)

`<Query>` `OR` `<Query>`

`NOT` `<Query>`

&nbsp;

● `<Query>` refers to "AQS statement"

● AQS is a case-insensitive statement, except for `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, which must be capitalized

> Example: A `AND` B

● AQS is bind from left to right, you can use parentheses to change the bind

> Example: A `OR` (B `AND` C)

&nbsp;

#### "Query" structure
*****
`<Prop>`:`<Basic Restr>`

&nbsp;

● `<Prop>` refers to "Properties"

● `<Basic Restr>` refers to "Restricted statements"

&nbsp;

##### Note
`<Prop>` is optional. If AQS does not contains `<Prop>`, all files properties matching `<Basic Restr>` will be searched. `<Basic Restr>` is a required option, this option must be specified.

&nbsp;

#### "Prop" structure
*****
`<Canonical Property Name>`

`<Property Label In UI Language>`

&nbsp;

● `<Canonical Property Name>` refers to "[Canonical Property Name](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/properties/props)"

● `<Property Label In UI Language>` refers to "The name of the property label" (varies with language changes)

&nbsp;

#### "Basic Restr" structure
*****
`<Value>`

`<Operation>`<Value>`

`NOT` `<Basic Restr>`

`(<Restr>)`

&nbsp;

● `<Operation>` refers to "Operator"

● `<Value>` refers to "Expression"

● `<Restr>` refers to "Sub restriction statement"

&nbsp;

##### Note
`<Operation>` is optional. If AQS does not contains `<Operation>`, the most suitable operator will be selected according to the following rules. However, it is still recommended to always specify an operator explicitly to avoid unexpected results.

> If the value stored in the attribute is a string, the "COP_WORD_STARTSWITH" operator is assumed

> If the value stored in the attribute is not a string, the "COP_EQUAL" operator is assumed

&nbsp;

#### "Value" structure
*****
`[]`

`<Word>`

`<Number>`

`<DateTime>`

`<Boolean>`

`..`

`<Enumeration Range>`

&nbsp;

● `[]` refers to "Empty" or "Null"

● `<Word>` refers to "A string of consecutive strings without spaces"

● `<Number>` refers to "Integer or floating point number"

● `<DateTime>` refers to "Relative time or absolute time"

● `<Boolean>` refers to "True/False"

● `..` refers to "Range"

● `<Enumeration Range>` refers to "Enumeration range", format: `<Prop>`#`<Enumeration>`

> Example: System.Photo.LightSource#Daylight

&nbsp;
